# Cuneiform Tree-sitter Grammar (Single Source of Truth)

This is the canonical source for the Cuneiform language grammar and editor support. Both VSCode/Cursor and other editors consume this grammar to provide consistent language features.

## What's in here

- `grammar.js`: Tree-sitter grammar definition (authoritative source)
- `queries/`: Editor queries shared across IDEs
  - `highlights.scm`: **Story-focused semantic scopes** for theming
  - `indents.scm`: Indentation behavior
  - `outline.scm`: Symbols/outline
  - `brackets.scm`: Bracket/brace matching
- `scripts/`: Validation and testing utilities
  - `validate_scopes.py`: Semantic scope validation and coverage analysis
- `examples/`: Reference implementations and showcases
  - `theming_showcase.cune`: Demonstrates all semantic scopes for theme development
- `src/`: Generated parser artifacts (C code, JSON definitions)
- `tree-sitter-cuneiform.wasm`: Web build of the parser (for VSCode/web)
- `build.sh`: Build script for generating parser and WASM
- `test_queries.sh`: Enhanced validation tool with scope checking
- `SEMANTIC_SCOPES.md`: Complete documentation of all semantic scopes

## Development Workflow

### 1. Edit Grammar

Make changes to `grammar.js` and/or query files in `queries/`.

### 2. Build Grammar

```bash
# Quick build with the build script
./build.sh

# Or manually:
npx tree-sitter generate      # Generate parser from grammar.js
npx tree-sitter build --wasm   # Build WASM for VSCode
```

### 3. Test Grammar & Queries

```bash
npx tree-sitter test          # Run test corpus
npx tree-sitter parse example.cune  # Test on a file

# Test all query files with scope validation (recommended)
./test_queries.sh             # Validates highlights, brackets, and semantic scopes

# Validate semantic scopes independently
python3 scripts/validate_scopes.py  # Check scope coverage and conventions

# Test theming with showcase file
npx tree-sitter highlight examples/theming_showcase.cune
```

### 4. Update VSCode Extension

```bash
cd ../vscode
./build-install.sh            # Rebuilds and installs to VSCode/Cursor
```

### 5. Reload Editor

Restart your editor or run "Developer: Reload Window" to see changes.

## Semantic Scopes for Story Authors

The grammar provides **story-focused semantic scopes** that enable rich theming for different writing workflows. These scopes are defined in `queries/highlights.scm` and consumed by editor extensions.

### Core Story Structure Scopes
- `markup.heading.1.story.act` - Act headers (`= Act One`)
- `markup.heading.2.story.scene` - Scene headers (`== Opening Scene`)
- `markup.heading.3.story.cel` - Cel headers (`=== Hero's Introduction`)

### Content Type Scopes
- `keyword.control.content.beat` - Beat markers (`///`)
- `keyword.control.content.treatment` - Treatment markers (`//`)
- `keyword.control.content.narrative` - Narrative markers (`/`)

### Author vs Story Content
- `comment.line` - Author notes (`# comments`)
- `text.narrative` - Story prose and dialogue
- `text.parenthetical` - Action directions
- `entity.name.reference` - Character/location references (`{Hero}`)

### Theme Integration
These semantic scopes enable:
- **Story author themes** optimized for screenplay, novel, or general writing
- **Content layer distinction** between planning (beats) and final text (narrative)
- **Visual hierarchy** with acts > scenes > cels
- **Clear separation** between author notes and story content

Extensions use these scopes to provide themes like "Cuneiform Screenplay" (Courier fonts, script colors) or "Cuneiform Novel" (serif fonts, prose-optimized colors).

## Grammar Features (v1.0 - Production Ready)

The grammar successfully supports all major Cuneiform syntax elements:

### âœ… Fully Working Features

#### Story Structure
- **Headers**: `= Act`, `== Scene`, `=== Cel with location/time`
- **File headers**: `TITLE:`, `WORLD:`, `FORMAT:`, etc.
- **Content hierarchy**: Acts â†’ Scenes â†’ Cels organization

#### Screenplay-Style Dialogue
- **Character speakers**: `{Hero}` as dialogue speaker names
- **Indented dialogue**: Clean dialogue without quotes
- **Parentheticals**: `(whispering)` action directions
- **Mixed content**: Seamless integration of dialogue and prose

#### Entity System
- **Definitions**: `@character Hero`, `@location Castle`, etc.
- **Block definitions**: `@characters { ... }` with arbitrary content
- **Nested blocks**: `@eras { ... }` within entities using balanced braces algorithm
- **Entity references**: `{Hero}` in content with semantic highlighting

#### Content Types
- `///` - Beats (structural story beats)
- `//` - Treatments (scene direction and mood)
- `/` - Narrative (final story text)

#### Imports & Adapters
- **Imports**: `@import "file.yaml" #selector`
- **Adapters**: `@adapter "adapter.yaml" @timing:pre`

#### Metadata & Comments
- **Metadata**: `+key: value` pairs (note: `+` prefix)
- **Comments**: `# This is a comment`

### ðŸŸ¡ Minor Edge Cases (Production Ready)
- 16 minor parsing errors in comprehensive test files
- All core features work reliably
- Fallback highlighting handles edge cases gracefully
- See `PARSING_STATUS.md` for detailed status

## Integration Points

### VSCode/Cursor Extension

The VSCode extension (`../vscode/`) uses this grammar to provide:
- Syntax highlighting via semantic tokens
- Document outline and symbols
- Hover information for entities
- Go-to-definition for entity references
- Code folding for blocks

### Zed Extension  

For Zed editor integration, reference this grammar directly from the extension manifest.

### Web Playground

The WASM build can be used in web applications for browser-based Cuneiform editing.

## Testing

### Grammar & Query Validation

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Validate all queries against grammar (recommended first step)
./test_queries.sh

# Run all grammar tests
./test_runner.sh

# Test individual files
tree-sitter parse test_cases/02_entity_blocks.cune
tree-sitter parse test_cases/03_nested_blocks.cune

# Test with real-world examples
tree-sitter parse ../../examples/habitatable/world_with_inline_eras.cune
```

### Query Validation (`test_queries.sh`)

This script validates that all editor queries work with the current grammar:
- Tests `highlights.scm` semantic scopes against actual parse nodes
- Validates `brackets.scm`, `indents.scm`, and `outline.scm`
- Discovers available node types for debugging
- **Must pass before updating extensions** to avoid editor errors

### Grammar Status Summary

# Test specific file
npx tree-sitter parse test.cune

# Generate test expectations
npx tree-sitter test -u
```

## Extracting to Separate Repository

When ready to make this a standalone package:

1. **Copy this directory** to a new repository
2. **Initialize as npm package**: 
   ```bash
   npm init
   npm install --save-dev tree-sitter-cli
   ```
3. **Set up CI/CD** for automated builds
4. **Publish to npm** as `tree-sitter-cuneiform`
5. **Update consumers** to reference the npm package

## Files to Keep in Sync

When making changes, ensure these stay aligned:
- `grammar.js` - Core grammar definition
- `queries/*.scm` - Query files for editor features
- `../vscode/extension.js` - VSCode patterns should match grammar
- Test corpus - Keep tests up to date with new features

## Semantic Scopes for Theming

The Cuneiform grammar provides rich semantic scopes designed specifically for story-focused theming. This enables theme authors to create specialized color schemes that highlight different narrative elements.

### Key Semantic Categories

- **Story Structure**: `markup.heading.*.story.*` - Act, scene, and cel headers
- **Content Types**: `keyword.control.content.*` - Beat, treatment, narrative markers
- **Entity References**: `entity.name.*` - Characters, locations, items in story text
- **Dialogue**: `entity.name.character.speaker`, `text.parenthetical` - Screenplay-style dialogue

### Testing Your Theme

Use the provided showcase file to test all semantic scopes:

```bash
# View with syntax highlighting
npx tree-sitter highlight examples/theming_showcase.cune

# Validate scopes are working
python3 scripts/validate_scopes.py
```

### Documentation

See [SEMANTIC_SCOPES.md](SEMANTIC_SCOPES.md) for complete documentation of all scopes, theming integration examples, and contribution guidelines.

## Technical Implementation

### Balanced Braces Algorithm (v0.2.0)

The key innovation in this version is the balanced braces approach for handling nested blocks:

```javascript
// Entity blocks can contain nested { ... } patterns
entity_block: ($) =>
  seq(
    "@", field("block_type", /\w+/), /\s*/, "{",
    repeat(choice(
      $.balanced_braces,  // Handles nested @eras { ... }
      /[^{}]+/,          // Regular content
      $.newline
    )),
    "}"
  ),

// Recursive rule for balanced braces
balanced_braces: ($) =>
  seq(
    "{",
    repeat(choice(
      $.balanced_braces,  // Recursive for deeper nesting
      /[^{}]+/,
      $.newline
    )),
    "}"
  )
```

This solves the fundamental parsing conflict where `@eras {` inside `@characters {` was being interpreted as a new top-level entity block.

## Common Issues

### WASM not updating
- Ensure you run `tree-sitter build --wasm` after grammar changes
- Clear VSCode extension cache if needed

### Highlighting not working
- Check `queries/highlights.scm` for proper captures
- Verify semantic token mapping in VSCode extension

### Parser conflicts
- Run `tree-sitter generate` to see conflict warnings
- Adjust rule precedence in `grammar.js` as needed

### Nested blocks not parsing
- Fixed in v0.2.0 with balanced braces algorithm
- Ensure you're using the latest grammar build
